                    London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United 
                    Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.

                    Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement
                     for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans,
                    who named it Londinium.
