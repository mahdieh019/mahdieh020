                The project began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project by Dave Hyatt, 
                Joe Hewitt, and Blake Ross. They believed the commercial requirements of
                 Netscape's sponsorship and developer-driven feature creep compromised the utility 
                 of the Mozilla browser.[37] To combat what they saw as the Mozilla Suite's software bloat, 
                 they created a stand-alone browser, with which they intended to replace the Mozilla Suite.
                 [38] On April 3, 2003, the Mozilla Organization announced that they planned to change their
                    focus from the Mozilla Suite to Firefox and Thunderbird.[39] The community-driven SeaMonkey
                 was formed and eventually replaced the Mozilla Application Suite in 2005.

                In 1836 William Cornwallis Harris led an expedition purely to observe 
                and record wildlife and landscapes by the expedition's members. Harris
                 established the safari style of journey, starting with a not too strenuous
                  rising at first light, an energetic day walking, an afternoon rest then concluding
                   with a formal dinner and telling stories in the evening over drinks and 
                   tobacco.[3] The hunting aspect traditionally associated with the safari is said 
                   to have its origins in the early 1800s in the region of Ã‰vora, Alentejo, where
                    villagers got together to hunt wild boar and reclaim land for farming.
